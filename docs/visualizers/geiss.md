# Geiss (deprecated — use TextLayers)

## Status

**Removed.** The standalone Geiss `IVisualizer` mode has been removed. Geiss-style content is available as layers in **Layered text** (`TextLayersVisualizer`):

- **GeissBackground** — Psychedelic plasma-style background; sine-based plasma with bass/treble modulation.
- **BeatCircles** — Expanding circles spawned on beat.

In the app (Layered text mode only), add or select a layer and cycle its type with **←/→** to `GeissBackground` or `BeatCircles`. See [text-layers.md](text-layers.md) for layer configuration and key bindings.
