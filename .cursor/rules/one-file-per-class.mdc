# One File Per Class

Prefer one file per class, interface, or struct.

- Each top-level type in a `.cs` file should generally have its own file.
- File name should match the primary type (e.g. `TextLayerDrawContext.cs` contains `TextLayerDrawContext`).

**Allowed exceptions:** Small, tightly coupled types (e.g. DTOs used only by one consumer) may be kept in the same file when justified. Prefer splitting when types grow or gain their own consumers.

```csharp
// BAD: multiple unrelated types in one file
// TextLayerDrawContext.cs
public struct FallingLetterState { }
public sealed class TextLayerDrawContext { }
public sealed class GeissBackgroundState { }
public sealed class BeatCirclesState { }

// GOOD: one primary type per file
// FallingLetterState.cs
public struct FallingLetterState { }

// TextLayerDrawContext.cs
public sealed class TextLayerDrawContext { }
```
