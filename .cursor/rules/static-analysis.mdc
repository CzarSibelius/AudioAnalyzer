# Static analysis

After making code changes, check linter diagnostics for the modified files (use read_lints for those paths).

- **Fix all reported errors.**
- **Fix warnings** unless the rule is explicitly disabled for that line (e.g. pragma or editorconfig).

Do not complete code edits without addressing any linter errors in the files you changed.
