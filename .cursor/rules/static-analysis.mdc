# Static analysis

After making code changes, check linter diagnostics for the modified files (use read_lints for those paths).

- **Fix all reported errors.**
- **Fix warnings** unless the rule is explicitly disabled for that line (e.g. pragma or editorconfig).

Code style rules enforced at build time include: empty catch blocks (RCS1075), one file per class (RCS1060), and braces for control flow (IDE0011). See `.editorconfig` and `.cursor/rules/csharp-standards.mdc`.

Do not complete code edits without addressing any linter errors in the files you changed.
