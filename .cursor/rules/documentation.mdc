# Documentation

When adding or changing features:

1. **Update feature documentation**: Update the README and any other feature docs (e.g. `docs/` or a dedicated feature file). Document new capabilities, options, and behavior in the appropriate place.

2. **Update the README**: When changing behavior, dependencies, or usage, update README.md so these sections stay accurate:
   - Prerequisites
   - How to Run
   - Usage
   - What It Does
   - Dependencies
   - Notes

Do not complete feature work without updating the relevant documentation.
